# NSSP_DQ

National Syndromic Surveillance Program (NSSP) data quality metrics/analysis. Uses both the Rnssp package and the BioSense server.

Files #1 - #4 must be run on the NSSP RStudio Workbench in order to access the BioSense SQL server. File #5 can be run on any instance of R/RStudio with internet access, as it doesn't use the BioSense server. Feel free to email me with questions: firstname.lastname@uky.edu
