# NSSP_DQ

National Syndromic Surveillance Program (NSSP) data quality metrics/analysis and a few simple walkthroughs. I'll try to continue to update these files and add other walkthroughs with explanations. Files #1 - #4 must be run on the NSSP RStudio Workbench in order to access the BioSense SQL server. File #5 can be run on any instance of R/RStudio with internet access, as that file exclusively uses the Rnssp package (https://github.com/CDCgov/Rnssp). 

The state data quality report template also needs to be run on the NSSP RStudio Workbench as it accesses the BioSense SQL server. 

Feel free to email me with questions: firstname.lastname@uky.edu.
